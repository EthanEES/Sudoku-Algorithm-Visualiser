#  Final Year Project Diary ðŸ“š

This is the diary linked to my final year project referenceing what i have done on a day to day basis in terms of what research i have done, the files i have updated or added, and any general additions or thoughts I may have about the project im working on.

##  21/11/24: Day 7 - Sudoku Grid Creation and Error prevention

This day i spent my time adding proper functionallity to the buttons so that they actually work and control the grid elements. This research and practice with javascript will come in handy later when programming the algorithms. Additionally i refactored the original grid component so that it takes in 2 parameters when called upon so that the grid size can be changed, This linked to the size button which is programmed to alter this variable of the grid when needed. 

##  20/11/24: Day 6 - Sudoku Grid Creation and Error prevention

Today i spent time createing some baseplate buttons for the grid functionallity so that the user can change the size, generate a random grid and clear the grid.

##  17/11/24: Day 5 - Sudoku Grid Creation and Error prevention

Just made some bug fixes on the code adding the correct google fonts link to the font i wanted to use and applied it to the text across the page 

##  24/10/24: Day 4 - Sudoku Grid Creation and Error prevention

Today I continued working on the website and managed to add some react and js to create a sudoku grid on the page. It resemples the actual sudoku game showing the actual 3x3 boxs within the overall 9x9. This is all created in a loop which generates a div per box and added to an array so i can refer to each box individually and make any overall changes or checks. The grid has also been made editable with **ONLY** numbers to prevent the user from placing letters in the base game.

##  23/10/24: Day 3 - Next.js and React Webpage

On this day I refactored the template boilerplate from next.js and added a navbar base to the website. This will be used to hold all of the options for the game selecting between the different game modes and algorithm types. I also used photoshop to create a logo for my website aswell as a favicon to go with it. 

##  22/10/24: Day 2 - Next.js and React Webpage

Today I created the initial webpage for my project using the chosen framework, Next.js along side React. I installed and set up the required libraries and framework node.js on to my computers and used npm create-next-app to create a webpage to use. I tidied up the folder and template site then set up the website to be deployed on a website called vercel. The deployment worked and the site was ready to be expanded.

##  02/10/24: Day 1 - Gitlab set up and Research
